# Service Device App

In this project is bulit service manual for factory's devices.

It is CRUD and ahs Azure SQL database which is queried if 
user pushs Load or Save button

The front-end is done by React and React Hooks and I have used following [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-crud-context-hooks] (tuotrial).

The project folder needs to be loaded to computer adn one needs to have node.js installed on computer. Then user needs to set SQL database password which I give.
